To keep things simple for now, we won't perform the standard practices of separating out the data to training and test sets, or performing k-fold cross-validation. We will see examples of these in the later sections on real datasets. \n","\n","Keras has great documentation at https://keras.io/ so I won't go into every single detail, but will give a general overview.\n","\n","We will use the *Sequential* model API available [here](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/). The Sequential model allows us to build deep neural networks, by stacking layers one on top of another. Since we're now building a simple logistic regression model, we will have the input nodes directly connected to output node, without any hidden layers.\n","\n","Quick clarification to disambiguate the terms being used. In neural networks literature, it's common to talk about input nodes and output nodes. This may sound strange at first glance, what's an input *node* per se? When we say input nodes, we're talking about the features of a given dataset. In our case we have 2 features, the x and y coordinates of the points we plotted above, so we have 2 input nodes. You can simply think of it as a vector of 2 numbers. What about the output node then? The output of the logistic regression model is a single number, the probability of an input data point belonging to class 1. In other words $P(class=1|X)$. The probability of an input point belonging to class 0 is then $P(class=0|X) = 1 - P(class=1|X)$. You can simply think of the output node as a vector with a single number between 0 and 1.\n","\n","In Keras we don't add layers corresponding to input nodes, we only do this for hidden nodes and output nodes. In our current model, we don't have any hidden layers, the input nodes are directly connected to the output node. This means our neural network definition in Keras will just have one layer with one node, corresponding to the output node.\n","\n","The *Dense* function in Keras constructs a fully connected neural network layer, automatically initializing the weights and biases randomly. It's a super useful function that you will see everywhere. The function arguments are defined as follows:\n","- *units*: The first argument, the number of nodes in this layer. Since we're constructing the output layer, and we said it has only one node, this value is 1.\n","- *input_shape*: We need to specify the input dimensions for the first layer in Keras models. We don't need to specify this argument for  the subsequent layers (which we don't have here but we will in later sections) because Keras can infer their dimensions automatically. In this case, our input dimensionality is 2, the x and y coordinates. The input_shape parameter expects a vector, so in our case it's simply a tuple with one number.\n","- *activation*: The activation function of a logistic regression model is the *logistic* function, or altenatively called as *sigmoid*. \n","\n","We then compile the Keras model with the *compile* function. This creates the neural network model by configuring the learning process. The model hasn't been trained yet. Right now we're specifying the optimizer to use and the loss function to minimize. Don't worry for now about these parameters as we will study it later in details. The arguments for the compile function are defined as follows:\n","- *optimizer*: Which optimizer to use in order to minimize the loss function. There are a lot of different optimizers, most of them based on gradient descent.  For now we will use the *adam* optimizer, which is the one community prefer to use by default.\n","\n","- *loss*: The loss function to minimize. Since we're building a binary 0/1 classifier, the loss function to minimize is *binary_crossentropy*. We will see other examples of loss functions in later sections.\n","- *metrics*: Which metric to report statistics on, for classification problems we set this as *accuracy*.\n","\n","Now comes the fun part of actually training the model. The arguments are as follows:\n","- *x*: The input data, we defined it as *X* above. It contains the x and y coordinates of the input points\n","- *y*: Not to be confused with the y coordinate of the input points. The class we're trying to predict: 0 or 1.\n","- *verbose*: Prints out the loss and accuracy, set it to 1 to see the output.\n","- *epochs*: Number of times to go over the training data. When training models we pass through the training data not just once but multiple times.\n","\n","The output of the fit method is the loss and accuracy at every epoch. We then plot it to see that the loss goes down to almost 0 over time, and the accuracy goes up to almost 1. Great! We have successfully trained our first neural network model with Keras. I know this was a long explanation, but I wanted to explain what we're doing in detail the first time.

There are a couple of differences, let's go over them one by one:\n","- Number of node in the **final** dense layer: LR uses 1 node, where SR has 3 nodes. Since we have 3 classes it makes sense for SR to have 3 nodes. Then the question is, why does LR uses only 1 node, it has 2 classes so it appears like we should have used 2 nodes instead. The answer is, because we can achieve the same result with using only 1 node. As we saw above, LR models the probability of an example belonging to class one: $P(class=1|X)$. And we can calculate class 0 probability by: $1 - P(class=1|X)$. But when we have more than 2 classes, we need individual nodes for each class. Because knowing the probability of one class doesn't let us infer the probability of the other classes.\n","- Activation function: LR used sigmoid activation function, SR uses *softmax*. It scales the probability of the output neurons such that they sum up to 1. So in our case $P(class=0|X) + P(class=1|X) + P(class=2|X) = 1$. It doesn't do it in a naive way by dividing individual probabilities by the sum though, it uses the exponential function. So, the higher values get emphasized more and lower values get \"squashed\".  We seen it in the lecture. You can simply think of it as a normalization function which let's us interpret the output values as probabilities.\n","- Loss function: In a binary classification problem like LR, the loss function is binary_crossentropy. In the multiclass case like SR, the loss function is categorical_crossentropy. Going into the theory behind loss functions is beyond the scope of this tutorial. But for now only knowing this property is enough.\n","- Fit function: LR used the vector y directly in the fit function, which has just one column with binary 0/1 values. When we're doing SR the labels need to be in *one-hot* representation. In our case y_cat is a matrix with 3 columns, where all the values are 0 except for the one that represents our class, and that is 1.\n","\n","It took a while to talk about all the differences between LR and SR, and it looks like as if there's a lot to learn. But again after some practice this will become a habit, and you won't even need to think about any of this.\n","\n","After all this theory let's take a step back and remember that LR is a linear classifier. SR is also a linear classifier, but for multiple classes. So the \"power\" of the model hasn't changed, it's still a linear model. We just generalized LR to apply it to a multiclass problem.\n","\n","Training the model gives us an accuracy of around 50%. The simplest possible technique which always predicts class 0 no matter what the input is would have an accuracy of 33%.
